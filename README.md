# MyStore Project Overview
[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/Ahmedelsa3eed/Simple-Store/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)
MyStore is Angular application that allows users to view a list of available products to purchase, add them to a shopping cart, and ultimately complete the checkout process.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Features
- **Product list page**, which displays the available products for the user to choose and add to their cart (in various quantities)
- **Product details page**, which displays more information about any particular product
- **Shopping cart**, which includes the products that the user has added to their cart
- **Checkout form**, which collects information about the user (e.g., name, address, payment details, etc.)
- **Order confirmation page**, which shows the outcome after the user completes the checkout process (i.e., submits the checkout form)
